Losslessly convert raster images to PDF without re-encoding PNG, JPEG, and
JPEG2000 images. This leads to a lossless conversion of PNG, JPEG and JPEG2000
images with the only added file size coming from the PDF container itself.
Other raster graphics formats are losslessly stored using the same encoding
that PNG uses. Since PDF does not support images with transparency and since
img2pdf aims to never be lossy, input images with an alpha channel are not
supported.

The output is sent to standard output so that it can be redirected into a file
or to another program as part of a shell pipe. To directly write the output
into a file, use the -o or --output option.

Options:

positional arguments:
  infile                Specifies the input file(s) in any format that can be
                        read by the Python Imaging Library (PIL). If no input
                        images are given, then a single image is read from
                        standard input. The special filename "-" can be used
                        once to read an image from standard input. To read a
                        file in the current directory with the filename "-"
                        (or with a filename starting with "-"), pass it to
                        img2pdf by explicitly stating its relative path like
                        "./-". Cannot be used together with --from-file.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose         Makes the program operate in verbose mode, printing
                        messages on standard error.
  -V, --version         Prints version information and exits.
  --gui                 run experimental tkinter gui
  --from-file FILE      Read the list of images from FILE instead of passing
                        them as positional arguments. If this option is used,
                        then the list of positional arguments must be empty.
                        The paths to the input images in FILE are separated by
                        NUL bytes. If FILE is "-" then the paths are expected
                        on standard input. This option is useful if you want
                        to pass more images than the maximum command length of
                        your shell permits. This option can be used with
                        commands like `find -print0`.

General output arguments:
  Arguments controlling the output format.

  -o out, --output out  Makes the program output to a file instead of standard
                        output.
  -C colorspace, --colorspace colorspace
                        Forces the PIL colorspace. See the epilogue for a list
                        of possible values. Usually the PDF colorspace would
                        be derived from the color space of the input image.
                        This option overwrites the automatically detected
                        colorspace from the input image and thus forces a
                        certain colorspace in the output PDF /ColorSpace
                        property. This is useful for JPEG 2000 images with a
                        different colorspace than RGB.
  -D, --nodate          Suppresses timestamps in the output and thus makes the
                        output deterministic between individual runs. You can
                        also manually set a date using the --moddate and
                        --creationdate options.
  --engine engine       Choose PDF engine. Can be either internal, pikepdf or
                        pdfrw. The internal engine does not have additional
                        requirements and writes out a human readable PDF. The
                        pikepdf engine requires the pikepdf Python module and
                        qpdf library, is most featureful, can linearize PDFs
                        ("fast web view") and can compress more parts of
                        it.The pdfrw engine requires the pdfrw Python module
                        but does not support unicode metadata (See
                        https://github.com/pmaupin/pdfrw/issues/39) or palette
                        data (See
                        https://github.com/pmaupin/pdfrw/issues/128).
  --first-frame-only    By default, img2pdf will convert multi-frame images
                        like multi-page TIFF or animated GIF images to one
                        page per frame. This option will only let the first
                        frame of every multi-frame input image be converted
                        into a page in the resulting PDF.
  --pillow-limit-break  img2pdf uses the Python Imaging Library Pillow to read
                        input images. Pillow limits the maximum input image
                        size to 89478485 pixels to prevent decompression bomb
                        denial of service attacks. If your input image
                        contains more pixels than that, use this option to
                        disable this safety measure during this run of img2pdf
  --pdfa [PDFA]         Output a PDF/A-1b compliant document. By default, this
                        will embed /usr/share/color/icc/sRGB.icc as the color
                        profile.

Image and page size and layout arguments:
  Every input image will be placed on its own page. The image size is controlled
  by the dpi value of the input image or, if unset or missing, the default dpi of
  96.00. By default, each page will have the same size as the image it shows.
  Thus, there will be no visible border between the image and the page border by
  default. If image size and page size are made different from each other by the
  options in this section, the image will always be centered in both dimensions.
  
  The image size and page size can be explicitly set using the --imgsize and
  --pagesize options, respectively.  If either dimension of the image size is
  specified but the same dimension of the page size is not, then the latter will
  be derived from the former using an optional minimal distance between the image
  and the page border (given by the --border option) and/or a certain fitting
  strategy (given by the --fit option). The converse happens if a dimension of
  the page size is set but the same dimension of the image size is not.
  
  Any length value in below options is represented by the meta variable L which
  is a floating point value with an optional unit appended (without a space
  between them). The default unit is pt (1/72 inch, the PDF unit) and other
  allowed units are cm (centimeter), mm (millimeter), and in (inch).
  
  Any size argument of the format LxL in the options below specifies the width
  and height of a rectangle where the first L represents the width and the second
  L represents the height with an optional unit following each value as described
  above.  Either width or height may be omitted. If the height is omitted, the
  separating x can be omitted as well. Omitting the width requires to prefix the
  height with the separating x. The missing dimension will be chosen so to not
  change the image aspect ratio. Instead of giving the width and height
  explicitly, you may also specify some (case-insensitive) common page sizes such
  as letter and A4.  See the epilogue at the bottom for a complete list of the
  valid sizes.
  
  The --fit option scales to fit the image into a rectangle that is either
  derived from the --imgsize option or otherwise from the --pagesize option.
  If the --border option is given in addition to the --imgsize option while the
  --pagesize option is not given, then the page size will be calculated from the
  image size, respecting the border setting. If the --border option is given in
  addition to the --pagesize option while the --imgsize option is not given, then
  the image size will be calculated from the page size, respecting the border
  setting. If the --border option is given while both the --pagesize and
  --imgsize options are passed, then the --border option will be ignored.
  
  The --pagesize option or the --imgsize option with the --border option will
  determine the MediaBox size of the resulting PDF document.

  -S LxL, --pagesize LxL
                        Sets the size of the PDF pages. The short-option is
                        the upper case S because it is an mnemonic for being
                        bigger than the image size.
  -s LxL, --imgsize LxL
                        Sets the size of the images on the PDF pages. In
                        addition, the unit dpi is allowed which will set the
                        image size as a value of dots per inch. Instead of a
                        unit, width and height values may also have a
                        percentage sign appended, indicating a resize of the
                        image by that percentage. The short-option is the
                        lower case s because it is an mnemonic for being
                        smaller than the page size.
  -b L[:L], --border L[:L]
                        Specifies the minimal distance between the image
                        border and the PDF page border. This value Is
                        overwritten by explicit values set by --pagesize or
                        --imgsize. The value will be used when calculating
                        page dimensions from the image dimensions or the other
                        way round. One, or two length values can be given as
                        an argument, separated by a colon. One value specifies
                        the minimal border on all four sides. Two values
                        specify the minimal border on the top/bottom and
                        left/right, respectively. It is not possible to
                        specify asymmetric borders because images will always
                        be centered on the page.
  -f FIT, --fit FIT     If --imgsize is given, fits the image using these
                        dimensions. Otherwise, fit the image into the
                        dimensions given by --pagesize. FIT is one of into,
                        fill, exact, shrink and enlarge. The default value is
                        "into". See the epilogue at the bottom for a
                        description of the FIT options.
  -a, --auto-orient     If both dimensions of the page are given via
                        --pagesize, conditionally swaps these dimensions such
                        that the page orientation is the same as the
                        orientation of the input image. If the orientation of
                        a page gets flipped, then so do the values set via the
                        --border option.
  --crop-border L[:L]   Specifies the border between the CropBox and the
                        MediaBox. One, or two length values can be given as an
                        argument, separated by a colon. One value specifies
                        the border on all four sides. Two values specify the
                        border on the top/bottom and left/right, respectively.
                        It is not possible to specify asymmetric borders.
  --bleed-border L[:L]  Specifies the border between the BleedBox and the
                        MediaBox. One, or two length values can be given as an
                        argument, separated by a colon. One value specifies
                        the border on all four sides. Two values specify the
                        border on the top/bottom and left/right, respectively.
                        It is not possible to specify asymmetric borders.
  --trim-border L[:L]   Specifies the border between the TrimBox and the
                        MediaBox. One, or two length values can be given as an
                        argument, separated by a colon. One value specifies
                        the border on all four sides. Two values specify the
                        border on the top/bottom and left/right, respectively.
                        It is not possible to specify asymmetric borders.
  --art-border L[:L]    Specifies the border between the ArtBox and the
                        MediaBox. One, or two length values can be given as an
                        argument, separated by a colon. One value specifies
                        the border on all four sides. Two values specify the
                        border on the top/bottom and left/right, respectively.
                        It is not possible to specify asymmetric borders.

Arguments setting metadata:
  Options handling embedded timestamps, title and author information.

  --title title         Sets the title metadata value
  --author author       Sets the author metadata value
  --creator creator     Sets the creator metadata value
  --producer producer   Sets the producer metadata value (default is: img2pdf
                        0.4.1)
  --creationdate creationdate
                        Sets the UTC creation date metadata value in YYYY-MM-
                        DD or YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM or YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS format
                        or any format understood by python dateutil module or
                        any format understood by `date --date`
  --moddate moddate     Sets the UTC modification date metadata value in YYYY-
                        MM-DD or YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM or YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS
                        format or any format understood by python dateutil
                        module or any format understood by `date --date`
  --subject subject     Sets the subject metadata value
  --keywords kw [kw ...]
                        Sets the keywords metadata value (can be given
                        multiple times)

PDF viewer arguments:
  PDF files can specify how they are meant to be presented to the user by a PDF viewer

  --viewer-panes PANES  Instruct the PDF viewer which side panes to show.
                        Valid values are "outlines" and "thumbs". It is not
                        possible to specify both at the same time.
  --viewer-initial-page NUM
                        Instead of showing the first page, instruct the PDF
                        viewer to show the given page instead. Page numbers
                        start with 1.
  --viewer-magnification MAG
                        Instruct the PDF viewer to open the PDF with a certain
                        zoom level. Valid values are either a floating point
                        number giving the exact zoom level, "fit" (zoom to fit
                        whole page), "fith" (zoom to fit page width) and
                        "fitbh" (zoom to fit visible page width).
  --viewer-page-layout LAYOUT
                        Instruct the PDF viewer how to arrange the pages on
                        the screen. Valid values are "single" (display single
                        pages), "onecolumn" (one continuous column),
                        "twocolumnright" (two continuous columns with odd
                        number pages on the right) and "twocolumnleft" (two
                        continuous columns with odd numbered pages on the
                        left)
  --viewer-fit-window   Instruct the PDF viewer to resize the window to fit
                        the page size
  --viewer-center-window
                        Instruct the PDF viewer to center the PDF viewer
                        window
  --viewer-fullscreen   Instruct the PDF viewer to open the PDF in fullscreen
                        mode

Colorspace:
  Currently, the colorspace must be forced for JPEG 2000 images that are not in
  the RGB colorspace.  Available colorspace options are based on Python Imaging
  Library (PIL) short handles.

    RGB      RGB color
    L        Grayscale
    1        Black and white (internally converted to grayscale)
    CMYK     CMYK color
    CMYK;I   CMYK color with inversion (for CMYK JPEG files from Adobe)

Paper sizes:
  You can specify the short hand paper size names shown in the first column in
  the table below as arguments to the --pagesize and --imgsize options.  The
  width and height they are mapping to is shown in the second column.  Giving
  the value in the second column has the same effect as giving the short hand
  in the first column. Appending ^T (a caret/circumflex followed by the letter
  T) turns the paper size from portrait into landscape. The postfix thus
  symbolizes the transpose. The values are case insensitive.

    A0       841mmx1189mm
    A1       594mmx841mm
    A2       420mmx594mm
    A3       297mmx420mm
    A4       210mmx297mm
    A5       148mmx210mm
    A6       105mmx148mm
    Legal    8.5inx14in
    Letter   8.5inx11in
    Tabloid  11inx17in

Fit options:
  The img2pdf options for the --fit argument are shown in the first column in
  the table below. The function of these options can be mapped to the geometry
  operators of imagemagick. For users who are familiar with imagemagick, the
  corresponding operator is shown in the second column.  The third column shows
  whether or not the aspect ratio is preserved for that option (same as in
  imagemagick). Just like imagemagick, img2pdf tries hard to preserve the
  aspect ratio, so if the --fit argument is not given, then the default is
  "into" which corresponds to the absence of any operator in imagemagick.
  The value of the --fit option is case insensitive.

    into    |   | Y | The default. Width and height values specify maximum
            |   |   | values.
   ---------+---+---+----------------------------------------------------------
    fill    | ^ | Y | Width and height values specify the minimum values.
   ---------+---+---+----------------------------------------------------------
    exact   | ! | N | Width and height emphatically given.
   ---------+---+---+----------------------------------------------------------
    shrink  | > | Y | Shrinks an image with dimensions larger than the given
            |   |   | ones (and otherwise behaves like "into").
   ---------+---+---+----------------------------------------------------------
    enlarge | < | Y | Enlarges an image with dimensions smaller than the given
            |   |   | ones (and otherwise behaves like "into").

Argument parsing:
  Argument long options can be abbreviated to a prefix if the abbreviation is
  unambiguous. That is, the prefix must match a unique option.

  Beware of your shell interpreting argument values as special characters (like
  the semicolon in the CMYK;I colorspace option). If in doubt, put the argument
  values in single quotes.

  If you want an argument value to start with one or more minus characters, you
  must use the long option name and join them with an equal sign like so:

    $ img2pdf --author=--test--

  If your input file name starts with one or more minus characters, either
  separate the input files from the other arguments by two minus signs:

    $ img2pdf -- --my-file-starts-with-two-minuses.jpg

  Or be more explicit about its relative path by prepending a ./:

    $ img2pdf ./--my-file-starts-with-two-minuses.jpg

  The order of non-positional arguments (all arguments other than the input
  images) does not matter.

Examples:
  Lines starting with a dollar sign denote commands you can enter into your
  terminal. The dollar sign signifies your command prompt. It is not part of
  the command you type.

  Convert two scans in JPEG format to a PDF document.

    $ img2pdf --output out.pdf page1.jpg page2.jpg

  Convert a directory of JPEG images into a PDF with printable A4 pages in
  landscape mode. On each page, the photo takes the maximum amount of space
  while preserving its aspect ratio and a print border of 2 cm on the top and
  bottom and 2.5 cm on the left and right hand side.

    $ img2pdf --output out.pdf --pagesize A4^T --border 2cm:2.5cm *.jpg

  On each A4 page, fit images into a 10 cm times 15 cm rectangle but keep the
  original image size if the image is smaller than that.

    $ img2pdf --output out.pdf -S A4 --imgsize 10cmx15cm --fit shrink *.jpg

  Prepare a directory of photos to be printed borderless on photo paper with a
  3:2 aspect ratio and rotate each page so that its orientation is the same as
  the input image.

    $ img2pdf --output out.pdf --pagesize 15cmx10cm --auto-orient *.jpg

  Encode a grayscale JPEG2000 image. The colorspace has to be forced as img2pdf
  cannot read it from the JPEG2000 file automatically.

    $ img2pdf --output out.pdf --colorspace L input.jp2
